# Decoding Immune Response in Leptomeningeal Disease through Single-Cell Sequencing of Cerebrospinal Fluid 

## ✨ Overview 

This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline associated with the paper: [**"Decoding Immune Response in Leptomeningeal Disease through Single-Cell Sequencing of Cerebrospinal Fluid"**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.27.634744v1). 🔬🧬🧠

Our study utilizes single-cell TNA and TCR sequencing, bulk TCR sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics (CosMx platform) to investigate the immune landscape of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with leptomeningeal disease (LMD). 🧪🧫🩸 

This repository provides all necessary scripts and instructions to reproduce the analysis performed in the paper. 📝💻📊

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Single-Cell-Genomics-Group-CNAG-CRG/CSF.git
cd REPO_NAME
```

### ✅  Set up the environments

To set up the Python environment:
```bash
cd notebooks/python
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate scRNAseq_python
```

To set up the R environment:
```bash
cd notebooks/R
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate scRNAseq_R
```

### 📊 Usage

After activating the corresponding environment(R/python), run the analysis step by step using Jupyter notebooks:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/python/` or `notebooks/R/` directory depending on the script
